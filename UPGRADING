Upgrading from 0.9.4 to 0.9.5

Install the ADODB database-abstraction software somewhere on your 
system and edit the new header.php to point to the adodb.inc.php file.
Also enter your database configuration in the header.php file, as config.inc.php
isn't used anymore. Load the upgrade_0.9.4_to_0.9.5-mysql.php script in your
 browser and follow the instructions.

Upgrading from 0.9.3.1 to 0.9.4

Load the 'upgrade_0.9.3.1_to_0.9.4.php' script in your browser and follow the
instructions.


Upgrading from 0.9.3 to 0.9.3.1

Simply unpack the new files into your old Flyspray directory.  If you overwrite
config.inc.php, you will need to re-edit it.

This bugfix release fixes the broken 'closed' status.  You will have previously
noticed that closing your tasks set them to 'waiting for customer'.  If you have
some tasks that are incorrectly set to that when you tried to close them, you are
now able to close them properly.

There are no database changes.
