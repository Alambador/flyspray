Generally none that I know of.  Feel free to report some.

Small issues:

- Konqueror 3.1 doesn't highlight the index rows unless you mouseover the hyperlink
to the task.
- The cursor doesn't change to a hand on Konqueror 3.1 or Mozilla Firebird 0.6. 
It works on Internet Explorer 6 and Opera 7.
