Flyspray -  A ten step getting-started guide.

Step One:  Unpack the tarball into the directory where your web server can reach
it.  It will extract into its own flyspray-version/ directory.  If you're reading this,
you've probably already done that.

Step Two:  Create a mysql database for Flyspray to use.  Here is one way to do
that, from the unix/linux command line, entering your mysql root password when
prompted:

mysqladmin -u root -p create flyspray

Step Three:  Import the Flyspray database tables into your new empty database.
Here is the unix/linux command line method, be sure to enter your mysql root
password when prompted:

mysql flyspray -u root -p < flyspray-version.sql

Step Four:  Edit the config.inc.php file to suit your database setup.  Examples
are provided in the file.

Step Five: Point your browser to http://yourserver.com/flyspray-version/ and you should
see Flyspray!  Login as 'super', with the password 'super'.

Step Six: Create youself a new user, place them into the Admin group.

Step Seven:  CHANGE THE PASSWORD FOR THE super/super ACCOUNT by clicking the
'Change Password' link near the top of the page.  You might like to disable
the account entirely, or it will appear in the list of members to be assigned
tasks.

Step Eight: Click on the admin links to set up your Options and lists.

Step Nine:  If you wish to be able to upload attachments, you will need to make the 
attachments/ directory writeable by the webserver process.  The easiest way to do
this is to make it world writeable.  In unix/linux this is done like this:

chmod a+rwx attachments

Note that this could be a security issue.  You really should learn to make it
only writable by the process running your webserver.

Step Nine: Close the sample task, and begin adding your own.
