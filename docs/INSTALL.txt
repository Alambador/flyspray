Flyspray -  A getting-started guide.

===== Preparing for install =====
  * Unpack the compressed package into a directory where your webserver can reach it.
    It will extract into its own flyspray-version/ directory.
    >  tar -xzvf flyspray-version.tar.gz flyspray/
  * Flyspray depends on ADOdb to provide support for different types of databases.
    If you don't already have ADOdb installed, Flyspray Setup can install it for you.
    If you want Setup to install ADOdb, then you need to make the adodb/ directory writeable
    by the webserver.
  * Flyspray comes with an empty flyspray.conf.php that Flyspray Setup needs to write to.
    Make it writeable by the webserver.
  * Create a Mysql database for Flyspray to use:
    >  mysqladmin -u root -p create flyspray;
  * Or, create a PostgreSQL database for Flyspray to use:
    >  createuser -ADP flyspray;
    >  createdb -E UNICODE -O flyspray flyspray;
  * If you would like to attach files to Flyspray tasks and comments, make the attachments/
    directory writeable by the webserver.

===== Installation =====
  * Point your browser to http://yourserver/flyspray/ and follow along with Flyspray Setup.
  * When Setup completes, you will be automatically logged-in, and taken to your user profile
    where you can change  details such as your Real Name.
  * If for some reason you can't use Flyspray Setup (or it doesn't work for you), then you could 
    try installing without it <http://flyspray.rocks.cc/manual/hardcore_install>.

If you would like to enable support for the Task Dependency Graphs feature <http://flyspray.rocks.cc/manual/dependencies%23task_dependency_graphs>,
an optional additional package can be installed to enable it. Most operating systems have a package
available for the free Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/> package, either in an OS-specific package
or by download direct from the Graphviz site. This package is required for this feature until bug 612
is implemented, after which your choice of an internet connection or the locally installed package
are required. If you have installed this package, but it still isn't working, look at the top of the
scripts/depends.php file in your Flyspray installation, and make sure the right path to the installed
"dot" excutable is in place.
(It is unknown if or how this feature works on Windows PCs, but bug 612 should make it accessible to those installations.)

===== After installation =====
  * Click the 'Manage Project' link to set up your project preferences, user groups and lists.
  * Close the sample task, and start adding your own, real tasks.
  * If you need help, read the documentation <http://flyspray.rocks.cc/manual/toc>,
    faq <http://flyspray.rocks.cc/faq>, and support <http://flyspray.rocks.cc/support> pages.
