Flyspray -  A ten step getting-started guide.

Step One:  Unpack the compressed package into a directory where your web
server can reach it.  It will extract into its own flyspray-version/ directory.
If you're reading this, you've probably already done that.

Step Two:  Create a mysql database for Flyspray to use.  Here is one way to do
that, from the unix/linux command line, entering your mysql root password when
prompted:

mysqladmin -u root -p create flyspray

If you prefer PostgreSQL, create flyspray database user:

createuser -ADP flyspray

and then a database itself:

createdb -E UNICODE -O flyspray flyspray

Step Three:  Point your browser to http://yourserver/flyspray-version/ and
follow along with the setup script.

Step Four: Create youself a new user, place them into the Admin group.

Step Five:  CHANGE THE PASSWORD FOR THE super/super ACCOUNT by clicking the
'Edit My Details' link near the top of the page.  You might like to disable
the account entirely, or it will appear in the list of users to be assigned
tasks.

Step Six: Click on the admin links to set up your Options and lists.

Step Seven: Click the Projects link to set up your project options, user groups
and lists.

Step Eight:  If you wish to be able to upload attachments, you will need to make
the attachments/ directory writeable by the webserver process.  The easiest way
to do this is to make it world writeable.  In unix/linux this is done like this:

chmod a+rwx attachments

Note that this could be a security issue.  You really should learn to make it
only writable by the process running your webserver.

Step Nine: Close the sample task, and begin adding your own.
