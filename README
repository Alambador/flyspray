G'day from Australia!

Thanks for downloading version 0.9.4 of Flyspray.  For installation
instructions, take a look at the INSTALL text file.  To upgrade from a
previous version, read the UPGRADING text file.

Flyspray is primarily being developed on Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 platform, using
Apache and MySQL with PHP modules. To report bugs or request features, use the
bug tracking system at http://flyspray.rocks.cc/bts/

Last thing - I am not responsible if you manage to hose your web server or any
databases by using this program, ok?
